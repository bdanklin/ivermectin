Remedy defines the producer and producer_consumer in the GenStage design. To consume the events you must create at least one consumer process.

Using Discord Voice Channels To play sound in Discord with Remedy, you'll need ffmpeg to be installed. If you don't have the executable ffmpeg in the path, the absolute path may be configured through config keys :remedy, :ffmpeg . If you don't want to use ffmpeg, read on to the next section. A bot may be connected to at most one voice channel per guild. For this reason, most of the functions in this module take a guild id, and the resulting action will be performed in the given guild's voice channel that the bot is connected to. The primary Discord gateway responsible for all text based communication relies on one websocket connection per shard, where small bots typically only have one shard. The Discord voice gateways work by establishing a websocket connection per guild/channel. After some handshaking on this connection, audio data can be sent over UDP/RTP. Behind the scenes the voice websocket connections are implemented nearly the same way the main shard websocket connections are, and require no developer intervention. Voice Without FFmpeg If you wish to BYOE (Bring Your Own Encoder), there are a few options.

Defaults to beginning. :duration (string) - The duration to of the audio to be played . Defaults to entire duration. :realtime (boolean) - Make ffmpeg process the input in realtime instead of as fast as possible. Defaults to true. :volume (number) - The output volume of the audio. Default volume is 1.0. :filter (string) - Filter(s) to be applied to the audio. No filters applied by default. The values of :start_pos and :duration can be any time duration that ffmpeg can read . The :filter can be used multiple times in a single call (see examples). The values of :filter can be any audio filters that ffmpeg can read . Filters will be applied in order and can be as complex as you want. The world is your oyster! Note that using the :volume option is shortcut for the &quot;volume&quot; filter, and will be added to the end of the filter chain, acting as a master volume. Volume values between 0.0 and 1.0 act as standard oparating range where 0 is off and 1 is max. Values greater than 1.0 will add saturation and distortion to the audio. Negative values act the same as their position but reverse the polarity of the waveform. Having all the ffmpeg audio filters available is extremely powerful so it may be worth learning some of them for your use cases. If you use any filters to increase the playback speed of your audio, it's recommended to set the :realtime option to false because realtime processing is relative to the original playback speed.

To ensure that every request is handled properly, no matter if they're called asynchronously or not, Remedy funnels all requests through a single GenServer . The ratelimiter at a high level works something like this: Request is sent to the serializer Serializer checks to see if there's a current block on that endpoint. If there is a block, the pid of the caller is stored, and a task is started to try the call again after a specified time stored from previous calls. If the request goes through, the headers are processed to see if a block should be instantiated for that endpoint.","ref":"api.html#ratelimiting","title":"Api - Ratelimiting","type":"extras"},{"doc":"If you only want to use the REST portion of the provided API, the only process needed is the ratelimiter.
