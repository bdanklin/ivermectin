Consuming Gateway Events To handle events, Remedy uses a GenStage implementation. Remedy defines the producer and producer_consumer in the GenStage design. To consume the events you must create at least one consumer process. It is generally recommended that you spawn a consumer per core. To find this number you can use System.schedulers_online/0 .
