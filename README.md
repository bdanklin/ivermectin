## Notes

- [ ] Separate applicable components into their own package.
  - [ ] Types - Timestamp / Snowflake
- [ ] Convert structs to Ecto Schema.
- [ ] Cache
  - [ ] Generalize. choose what to cache based on your resources.
  - [ ] Make it an actual cache, aka invisible and if the resource is not in cache, we should fetch it and return it as required.

## Installation
