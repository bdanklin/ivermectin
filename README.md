## Working on

- [ ] Separate applicable components into their own package.
- [ ] Types - Timestamp / Snowflake
- [ ] Convert structs Schema.
- [ ] Convert cache to Etso.
- [ ] Generalize cache.
- [ ] Make it an actual cache, aka invisible and if the resource is not in cache, we should fetch it and return it as required.
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Supply a bot secret thru workflow to enable actual testing on a real server. without exposing secrets (prob too hard)

## Installation

I do not recommend anybody install this, instead you should probably use [Nostrum](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum)
